Put these in your .bashrc

export PATH=~/wine/bin:~/wine64/bin:$PATH
alias win32='WINEPREFIX=~/.wine32 WINEARCH=win32'

To create a wine32 prefix run win32 wine winecfg in terminal, everytime you want to run a win32 app run win32 wine(this is not needed if you have the app installed and you have binfmt support in kernel)
