# BOX86 AND BOX64


Add armhf foreign architecture: sudo dpkg --add-architecture armhf


Run sudo apt update then, copy paste the following commands to install box86 and box64:

sudo wget https://ryanfortner.github.io/box64-debs/box64.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/box64.list

wget -O- https://ryanfortner.github.io/box64-debs/KEY.gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/box64-debs-archive-keyring.gpg 

sudo apt update && sudo apt install box64 -y

sudo wget https://itai-nelken.github.io/weekly-box86-debs/debian/box86.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/box86.list

wget -qO- https://itai-nelken.github.io/weekly-box86-debs/debian/KEY.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

sudo apt update && sudo apt install box86 -y

sudo ln /usr/local/bin/box86 /usr/bin/box86

sudo ln /usr/local/bin/box64 /usr/bin/box64



Afer running sudo apt update, download box86 and box64 dependencies:


sudo apt install zenity:armhf libasound*:armhf libstdc++6:armhf mesa*:armhf #box86 dependencies

sudo apt install mesa* zenity* gcc-multilib-x86-64-linux-gnu #box64 dependencies

# WINE


While you are in your home directory, create these two directories:


mkdir wine

mkdir wine64


Download wine binaries: wget http://www.playonlinux.com/wine/binaries/phoenicis/upstream-linux-x86/PlayOnLinux-wine-7.0-rc1-upstream-linux-x86.tar.gz


Download wine64 binaries: wget  http://www.playonlinux.com/wine/binaries/phoenicis/upstream-linux-amd64/PlayOnLinux-wine-6.14-upstream-linux-amd64.tar.gz


Extract both wine and wine64 in those two folders you had created before:


tar -xzvf PlayOnLinux-wine-7.0-rc1-upstream-linux-x86.tar.gz -C wine

tar -xzvf PlayOnLinux-wine-6.14-upstream-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C wine64


Add these lines to your /etc/profile:

export BOX86_PATH=~/wine/bin/

export BOX86_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/wine/lib/wine/i386-unix/:/lib/i386-linux-gnu:/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/

export BOX64_PATH=~/wine64/bin/

export BOX64_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~ /wine64/lib/i386-unix/: ~/wine64/lib/wine/x86_64-unix/:/lib/i386-linux-gnu/:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu:/usr/x86_64-linux-gnu/lib/ (spaces between ~ and / will need to be removed like the spaces between : and ~)

To make the changes effective, type the command 'source /etc/profile'. You can run 32bit programs with 'box86 wine name.exe' and 64bit ones with 'box64 wine64 name.exe' command. Remember that you can run either 32bit or 64bit at a time and if you want to switch you will have to delete your prefix.

To run wine32 without always deleting the prefix, append these lines to your .bashrc(spaces between ~ and / will need to be removed like spaces between : and ~):

export PATH=~ /wine/bin/: ~/wine64/bin/:$PATH

alias win32='WINEPREFIX=~/.wine32 WINEARCH=win32'

Type the command 'source .bashrc' to make the change effectives then to create a wine32 prefix run 'win32 wine winecfg' command in terminal, everytime you want to run a win32 app type 'win32 box86 wine programname.exe'.


# x86 and x64 BASH


Since it is hard to get binfmt support in Android, after a recent box86/64 update it is possible to use an alternative for it:

Make sure you have downloaded the latest executable of box86 and box64 you can find here then download bash_x86 and bash_x64 from here and put them in a folder in your home directory, and after giving them executable permission, in your /etc/profile add the following lines:

export BOX86_BASH=pathtobashx86/bash_x86
export BOX64_BASH=pathtobashx64/bash_x64

Type the command 'source /etc/profile' to make the changes effective in the current session. Now it should be possible to run stuffs like winetricks without binfmt_misc.

# WINETRICKS

Move the executable you find here into /use/bin and give it executable permission:

sudo mv pathtowinetricks/winetricks /usr/bin

sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/winetricks

When you want to execute winetricks, run the following command 'win32 box64 winetricks'
