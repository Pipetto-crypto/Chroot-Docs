Collection of scripts, docs that I used to setup my chroot. It's highly suggested that you download this repo and extract it somewhere on your device, all the docs here will assume that you did.


#INSTALLATION

Download Linux-Deploy from PlayStore.

In Linux Deploy, tap the icon with the three sliders and make sure you set the following options like this:

Distribution: rootfs

Installation Type: File

Source path: the path where you have stored the rootfs contained in the files section of this repo(/sdcard/path_to_this_repo/files/debian.tar.bz2)

SSH: Enable

PulseAudio: Enable --> Audio Settings/Port delete whatever is written there and leave it blank

Configure the rest of the other options to your needs and once you are done go back to the main menu, tap on the three dots icon and select Install

Once it finishes installing, open Termux and after giving executable permission to the linux-deploy script in the root of this repo move it to your $PATH: cp path_to_linux-deploy_script $PATH


Before you can run the chroot, you are required to install these dependecies:

pkg install root-repo
pkg install pulseaudio bindfs tsu openssh

To run the chroot, you just need to execute the script like this: linux-deploy start , running the script without any option will print a help screen. 

The first time you run the chroot, you are required to append these lines to your /etc/profile:

export DISPLAY=:0

export PULSE_SERVER=127.0.0.1

export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/runtime-yourchrootusername

Remember that if you set an user different than android, you are required to change all the recurrences of android in the linux-deploy  script as well
