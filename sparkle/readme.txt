To use Sparkle, first install the apk there and launch the app. Tap on EDIT USER.SH and delete everything you find there then start the server.

Use the -s option to prepare the chroot to work with sparkle  (linux-deploy start -s)

Once you have logged there, type the sparkle command 

If you are using a different desktop environment than lxqt, modify the script in /bin/sparkle accordingly
